# Raw Idea

**Game Concept:**
- Cats fall to the bottom of the screen (gravity-based falling like Tetris)
- Cats stack on top of each other from the bottom up
- Win condition: Reach the top with the fewest number of cats dropped

This is a Tetris-like stacking game where cats fall and stack upward. The goal is efficiency - use as few cats as possible to reach the top.
