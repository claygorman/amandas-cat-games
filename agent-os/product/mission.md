## The Problem

### Casual Games Lack Charm and Depth

Most browser-based casual games are either too simple to be engaging or too complex for quick sessions. Players want something that is immediately understandable yet offers mastery potential. Additionally, many games lack personality or visual appeal.

**Our Solution:** Cat Stack combines a simple core mechanic (timing-based dropping) with physics-based emergent gameplay, wrapped in a charming cat aesthetic. Easy to learn in seconds, but the physics create endless variety and skill expression.

## Differentiators

### Instant Play, No Friction
Unlike mobile app games, Cat Stack runs directly in the browser with no download, no account creation, and no tutorial required. Players can start stacking cats within seconds of discovering the game.

### Physics-Driven Replayability
Unlike static puzzle games, every round plays differently due to real physics simulation. The same drop can have different outcomes, creating memorable moments and encouraging "one more try" behavior.

### Charming Visual Identity
Unlike generic casual games, Cat Stack features a cohesive, cute art style with pastel colors and expressive cat characters. This creates emotional connection and shareability.
